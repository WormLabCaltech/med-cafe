## This notebook contains entries starting from April 3, 2017 onwards (open notebook).

### April 3, 2017: Strain selection.

Today, I selected the strains I will use for this project. They include:

* **MT4866: let-60(n2021)**, Chromosome: 4. Loss of function let-60 allele from
MIT. From: Greg Beitel / Horvitz Lab 2/93

* **MT2124: let-60(n1046gf)**, Chromosome: 4. Gain of function let-60 allele used
in the Han, Aroian Sternberg paper.

* **PS4187: sop-1(bx93)**, Chromosome: X. LOF dpy-22 allele used by Zhang and
Emmons. Claimed
to interact with *bar-1*.
**Accompanying note from strain** (I assume this is Moghal writing): I outcrossed
bx93 from pal-1; sop-1(bx93), but did not confirm the presence of sop-1(bx93).

* **PS4087: sop-1(sy622)**, Chromosome: X. LOF dpy-22 used in Moghal and Sternberg.
Claimed to interact with let-60.
**Accompanying note**: Backcrossed 4X

* **EW15: bar-1(ga80)**, Chromosome: X. *wnt* null mutant. Not the same allele as
used by Zhang and Emmons, but it is the same gene.


### April 17, 2017.
I came back from a cool trip to Zion National Park yesterday. Understandably, my
strains were a bit
starved, so I plated them. After plating, I waited for
the adults to come out looking for food. Then I picked adults from each strain and
bleached them using the protocol below to obtain eggs for a growth curve assay.

I finished bleaching the worms at 2:54pm on Monday April 17, 2017. Each strain
was bleached with 5&ndash;10 worms and I placed them in the 20&deg;C room.

**Bleaching protocol**:
* Prepare some **Alkaline Plate Solution** fresh.
* Add 20uL to a new plate.
* Add adult worms.
* Wait for bleach to dry. If worm carcasses remain, add more bleach. Repeat until
no more carcasses are visible.

**Alkaline Plate Solution**:
* 550uL ddH20
* 250uL 1M NaOH
* 200uL bleach

### April 20, 2017
Checked back on my worms, but most of them did not survive the bleaching protocol.
As a result, I have decided to plate bleach on to empty NGM plates from now on.
The liquid bleaching protocol is below:

**Bleaching protocol**:
* Take a full plate
* Rinse the worms off with M9
* Wash twice with M9
* Bleach with *Alkaline Liquid Solution* for 5min or so (until bodies are
  well-dissolved)
* Rinse with M9
* Plate

**Alkaline Liquid Solution**:
* 8.3mL ddH20
* 3.8mL 1M NaOH
* 3mL Bleach

Bleach finished at 10:43pm April 20, 2017

### April 21, 2017
At 10:30 or so, approximately 12 hours post-bleach, I transferred 50 or so worms
from each strain to a plate with food. I noticed a lot of heterogeneity in the
sizes of the worms, which suggests the worms should be starved for a while longer
before they are transferred.

### April 24, 2017
At 9:30am (71 hours post-bleach), I checked all the worm strains for growth.
On all strains except MT4866 were gravid adults (mainly 1 line of eggs, but some
  adults were already egg-laying). This suggests that
  they reached adulthood almost 5 hours earlier
  (at 65hrs post-starvation).

**MT4866** did not survive the starvation process well. Out of 50 or so larvae
picked, 2 adult animals remained, suggesting a 4% survival rate.

These results argue against synchronization by starvation. Instead, I must
synchronize by double or triple synchronization.

### April 27, 2017

At 4.30pm, I bleached **MT4866** nematodes in liquid. With these, I will roughly
monitor time to adulthood and I will bleach again once most worms are gravid. I
expect they will reach adulthood 10 hours later than wild-type worms.

### April 28, 2017

Today I had a committee meeting with Dianne Newman, Elliot Meyerowitz and Matt
Thompson. Lior Pachter was supposed to be there, but did not attend for unknown
reasons. We had a pleasant conversation, and they suggested many things, mainly
that I should graduate faster, although I have no desire to do so at this moment.

At 1:25pm, I bleached four strains, **EW15, MT2124, PS4187** and **PS4087**. I
will double bleach at 60 hours in order to harvest well-synchronized eggs.

### April 29, 2017

4:44pm: Checked **MT4866** that I bleached on April 27 at 4.30pm. Most worms
were early to late L4, with no gravid adults at 48hrs post-bleach. I saw one
or two very young adults out of a population of hundreds. Worryingly, there were
a substantial number of L1-L3 worms. I worry that these populations will persist
even after the second synchronization. If they do, I will have to find a way to
pick adults that is not dependent on the vulval formation.


### April 30, 2017

At 00:15am, I liquid bleached **MT4866**. When I looked at the plate, I could only
see a small number of gravid adults (20 or so). I bleached them anyways, but after
bleaching I could only see a small number of eggs (about 20) outside carcasses.
Including eggs inside carcasses, I expect I obtained 50--70 eggs. All in all,
this is not a good number for collection, but it may be enough to score
synchronicity.

At 1:00pm, I looked at **EW15, MT2124, PS4187** and **PS4087**, which I bleached
on April 28, 2017. Strains **MT2124** and **PS4187** were starved by the time I
looked at them, because I plated too many eggs. **EW15** and **PS4087** had a
lot of worms at L4 stage.

At 4.34pm, I bleached all strains one more time. I modified the bleaching
protocol as shown below (increased bleaching time):

**Bleaching protocol**:
* Take a full plate
* Rinse the worms off with M9
* Wash twice with M9
* Bleach with *Alkaline Liquid Solution* for **10min, shaking constantly**
* Rinse with M9
* Plate on/off food (depending on the strain).

After plating, I observed only one or two carcasses that still had eggs inside.
I believe I could probably increase bleaching even further to remove carcasses
even more. This time, one of the strains had a number of dauers. These dauers
were still moving thoroughly after plating, which makes me worried they survived
treatment. Tomorrow, I will check all strains again.

At 5:00pm I checked the April 28 strains. I saw mainly late L4s and no gravid
adults. My guess is that gravid adults will be available around midnight.

At midnight, I came back to look at the April 28 strains. No gravid adults were
visible, but the majority of worms were at the late L4 stage. That said, due to
an overconcentration of worms in the plate, it was impossible to tell exactly
what stage these animals were at.

At 10am, plates had laid the very first eggs (less than 50). This suggests that
the first eggs were fertilized almost 3hours earlier. This would place the
growth rate of these animals at 64hours and agrees well with my previous estimates.
**To be clear, 64 hours appears to be the last moment when these animals are YA.**

### May 1, 2017

At approximately 4.45pm, I bleached **EW15** and **MT2124** and left them in
virgin M9 (no cholesterol or ethanol added). I will plate them tomorrow when
all eggs have hatched at 6pm. If they cease to be young adults at 65 hours, this
means that worms plated at 7pm on May 2nd will be YA on May 5th until midday.
The worms were placed in plastic 5mL tubes with the caps on and allowed to lie
on their side to maximize oxygenation of water. Given the small number of eggs
in the
tube, I don't expect them to turn hypoxic, but before I leave tonight I will
place them on a shaker.
I will try to plate 100 or so worms per plate into 3 plates.


### May 2, 2017

At 8:30, plated **EW15, MT2124** on food. They had been on Virgin M9 for 28 hours
at 20C prior to this. Before plating, I checked worms for motion while on liquid
before opening the tubes. Lack of motion is a sign of hypoxia, but all worms were
thrashing vigorously.

From 10-11pm, I heat-shocked **PS4087** for 1hr (a bit over) at 33C.


### May 4, 2017
I plated some worms I bleached yesterday (**PS4087**) and am preparing to
bleach N2, **EW15** and **MT2124** again today.

### May 5, 2017
Starting at 6am in the morning, I collected **MT2124** young adults, which was
very easy due to their conspicuous Muv phenotype. I tried to pick worms that
had a MacDonald-shaped vulva though in some cases the Muv phenotype makes
this very hard to observe. A very small number of worms (less than 1% of the
  population) were gravid by the time I got to the plates, but no eggs had yet
  been laid.

I collected 50 worms per plate and I collected 4 plates in total. After collection
was finished, I transferred the worms to Eppendorf tubes using
ice cold **TE buffer** (not M9!!!!). I then spun down using a PicoFuge and
rinsed the worms again in TE buffer. I spun down once more, then transferred
the worms to 0.5mL collection tubes. I spun down all Eppendorfs and
transferred the bottom 100-200uL twice into the collection tubes. Then, I
removed most of the TE, and rinsed using 300uL Ambion TE. I spun in a
centrifuge, and accidentally spun above 10k RPM for a second, which destroyed
one of my four samples. Always spin at 6k RPM, that's plenty for worms that
are not moving any more. I removed the supernatant, then rinsed again using
300uL of Ambion TE. After spin-down, I removed most of the TE down to a volume
of approximately 20uL. I visually verified that 30 or so worms remained in the tube,
then flash froze them.

The entire procedure took about 2.5hours. Each plate was ready within 15 minutes
of picking. Washing and spinning took a significant amount of time.

I also picked **EW15** worms. This strain has a Pvul phenotype, and as a result
it was very hard to tell young adults from adults. I picked slightly older adults
on average than for **MT2124**. At the end of the TE wash steps, I checked to
visually confirm there were worms on each tube. Unfortunately, 2/4 samples had
lost the majority of worms. To address this, I combined three samples. I will
need to collect worms at a later time.

### May 6, 2017
I looked at **MT4866** today at 11:10 or so. The worms had been placed on food on
May 4, at 1:43pm. This plate contained predominantly young adults that had just
exited the molt stage, which means their growth rate is approximately 57 hours.
This agrees well with my previous estimates of 56 hours.
I tried to use a goose-neck to select worms based on alae morphology, which should
be unique to adults.

I picked 8 worms and looked under Nomarski. All 8 worms had alae, but half or so
had still not exited the molt. However, they were moving actively and pumping,
suggesting that they were at the tail end of the molt. I will need to check with
Paul whether this stage is appropriate. I feel it is close enough, but he might
feel differently.

### May 7, 2017
Today at 6pm I picked **EW15** worms that had been seeded at 10am on May 5.
This would put their age at 56 hours. The worms were much younger than last time,
and the Pvul phenotype was proportionately weaker. I picked ~150 worms. After I
transferred the worms to the final tube, I made the mistake of spinning them down.
This has the unwanted effect of making the worms stick to the tube and they could
not be readily unstuck, which caused me to lose a lot of worms. In the future,
do not spin down 0.5mL tubes in a large centrifuge. Wait for worms to gravitate
down. This should only take a couple of minutes if they are kept ice cold.
