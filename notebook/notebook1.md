# E-Notebook for David Angeles-Albores for the purposes of the *dpy-22* allelic series project

## This notebook contains entries starting from April 3, 2017 onwards (open notebook).

### April 3, 2017: Strain selection.

Today, I selected the strains I will use for this project. They include:

* **MT4866: let-60(n2021)**, Chromosome: 4. Loss of function let-60 allele from
MIT. From: Greg Beitel / Horvitz Lab 2/93

* **MT2124: let-60(n1046gf)**, Chromosome: 4. Gain of function let-60 allele used
in the Han, Aroian Sternberg paper.

* **PS4187: sop-1(bx93)**, Chromosome: X. LOF dpy-22 allele used by Zhang and
Emmons. Claimed
to interact with *bar-1*.
**Accompanying note from strain** (I assume this is Moghal writing): I outcrossed
bx93 from pal-1; sop-1(bx93), but did not confirm the presence of sop-1(bx93).

* **PS4087: sop-1(sy622)**, Chromosome: X. LOF dpy-22 used in Moghal and Sternberg.
Claimed to interact with let-60.
**Accompanying note**: Backcrossed 4X

* **EW15: bar-1(ga80)**, Chromosome: X. *wnt* null mutant. Not the same allele as
used by Zhang and Emmons, but it is the same gene.


### April 17, 2017.
I came back from a cool trip to Zion National Park yesterday. Understandably, my
strains were a bit
starved, so I plated them. After plating, I waited for
the adults to come out looking for food. Then I picked adults from each strain and
bleached them using the protocol below to obtain eggs for a growth curve assay.

I finished bleaching the worms at 2:54pm on Monday April 17, 2017. Each strain
was bleached with 5&ndash;10 worms and I placed them in the 20&deg;C room.

**Bleaching protocol**:
* Prepare some **Alkaline Plate Solution** fresh.
* Add 20uL to a new plate.
* Add adult worms.
* Wait for bleach to dry. If worm carcasses remain, add more bleach. Repeat until
no more carcasses are visible.

**Alkaline Plate Solution**:
* 550uL ddH20
* 250uL 1M NaOH
* 200uL bleach

### April 20, 2017
Checked back on my worms, but most of them did not survive the bleaching protocol.
As a result, I have decided to plate bleach on to empty NGM plates from now on.
The liquid bleaching protocol is below:

**Bleaching protocol**:
* Take a full plate
* Rinse the worms off with M9
* Wash twice with M9
* Bleach with *Alkaline Liquid Solution* for 5min or so (until bodies are
  well-dissolved)
* Rinse with M9
* Plate

**Alkaline Liquid Solution**:
* 8.3mL ddH20
* 3.8mL 1M NaOH
* 3mL Bleach

Bleach finished at 10:43pm April 20, 2017

### April 21, 2017
At 10:30 or so, approximately 12 hours post-bleach, I transferred 50 or so worms
from each strain to a plate with food. I noticed a lot of heterogeneity in the
sizes of the worms, which suggests the worms should be starved for a while longer
before they are transferred.

### April 24, 2017
At 9:30am (71 hours post-bleach), I checked all the worm strains for growth.
On all strains except MT4866 were gravid adults (mainly 1 line of eggs, but some
  adults were already egg-laying). This suggests that
  they reached adulthood almost 16 hours earlier
  (at 55hrs post-starvation).

**MT4866** did not survive the starvation process well. Out of 50 or so larvae
picked, 2 adult animals remained, suggesting a 4% survival rate.

These results argue against synchronization by starvation. Instead, I must
synchronize by double or triple synchronization.

### April 27, 2017

At 4.30pm, I bleached **MT4866** nematodes in liquid. With these, I will roughly
monitor time to adulthood and I will bleach again once most worms are gravid. I
expect they will reach adulthood 10 hours later than wild-type worms.

### April 28, 2017

Today I had a committee meeting with Dianne Newman, Elliot Meyerowitz and Matt
Thompson. Lior Pachter was supposed to be there, but did not attend for unknown
reasons. We had a pleasant conversation, and they suggested many things, mainly
that I should graduate faster, although I have no desire to do so at this moment.

At 1:25pm, I bleached four strains, **EW15, MT2124, PS4187** and **PS4087**. I
will double bleach at 60 hours in order to harvest well-synchronized eggs.

### April 29, 2017

4:44pm: Checked **MT4866** that I bleached on April 27 at 4.30pm. Most worms
were early to late L4, with no gravid adults at 48hrs post-bleach. I saw one
or two very young adults out of a population of hundreds. Worryingly, there were
a substantial number of L1-L3 worms. I worry that these populations will persist even
after the second synchronization. If they do, I will
have to find a way to pick adults that is not dependent
on the vulval formation.
