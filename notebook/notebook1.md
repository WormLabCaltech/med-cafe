### April 3, 2017: Strain selection.

Today, I selected the strains I will use for this project. They include:

* **MT4866: let-60(n2021)**, Chromosome: 4. Loss of function let-60 allele from MIT. From: Greg Beitel / Horvitz Lab 2/93

* **MT2124: let-60(n1046gf)**, Chromosome: 4. Gain of function let-60 allele used
in the Han, Aroian Sternberg paper.

* **PS4187: sop-1(bx93)**, Chromosome: X. LOF dpy-22 allele used by Zhang and Emmons. Claimed
to interact with *bar-1*.
**Accompanying note from strain** (I assume this is Moghal writing): I outcrossed bx93 from pal-1; sop-1(bx93), but did not confirm the presence of sop-1(bx93).

* **PS4087: sop-1(sy622)**, Chromosome: X. LOF dpy-22 used in Moghal and Sternberg. Claimed to interact with let-60.
**Accompanying note**: Backcrossed 4X

* **EW15: bar-1(ga80)**, Chromosome: X. *wnt* null mutant. Not the same allele as used by Zhang and Emmons, but it is the same gene.


### April 17, 2017.
I came back from a cool trip to Zion National Park yesterday. Understandably, my strains were a bit
starved, so I plated them. After plating, I waited for
the adults to come out looking for food. Then I picked adults from each strain and bleached them using the protocol below to obtain eggs for a growth curve assay.

I finished bleaching the worms at 2:54pm on Monday April 17, 2017. Each strain was bleached with 5&ndash;10 worms and I placed them in the 20&deg;C room.

**Bleaching protocol**:
* Prepare some **Alkaline Plate Solution** fresh.
* Add 20uL to a new plate.
* Add adult worms.
* Wait for bleach to dry. If worm carcasses remain, add more bleach. Repeat until no more carcasses are visible.

**Alkaline Plate Solution**:
* 550uL ddH20
* 250uL 1M NaOH
* 200uL bleach
