abstract = {The let-60 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans controls the choice between vulval and hypodermal differentiation in response to an inductive signal from the gonad. let-60 encodes a ras protein that acts downstream of the let-23 receptor tyrosine kinase in a signal transduction pathway. Dominant-negative mutations of let-60 [let-60(dn)] cause a reduction of the gene activity in let-60(dn)/+ heterozygotes and a vulva-less mutant phenotype. We have found that nine let-60(dn) mutations cause replacements of conserved residues. Four are in two novel positions; others are in positions known previously to cause dominant-negative mutations in mammalian cells. The locations of these lesions suggest that they disrupt the ability of the ras protein to bind guanine nucleotides. Four let-60(dn) mutant genes were introduced into wild-type animals in the form of extrachromosomal arrays and were found to generate three dominant phenotypes--lethality, vulva-less, or multivulva--depending on gene dose and alleles. The dominant lethality caused by high-dose transgenic let-60(dn) genes suggests a toxic effect of these mutant genes in early development. The dominant-negative effects of these mutations in heterozygotes are likely to be caused by competition between let-60(dn) and let-60(+) protein for a positive regulator. All let-60(dn) mutations interfere with let-60(+) activity, but some alleles have partial constitutive activity, suggesting that the ability to interact with the activator is separable from the ability to exert a physiological effect (stimulation of vulval differentiation). These dn mutations might be useful for interfering with ras-mediated signal transduction pathways in other multicellular organisms.},

The lin-15 locus controls two separate genetic activities. Mutants that lack both activities have multiple, ectopic pseudo-vulvae resulting from the overproduction of vulval cells, whereas mutants defective in only one lin-15 activity appear wild-type. lin-15 acts non-cell-autonomously to prevent the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase/ras signaling pathway. We report here the molecular characterization of the lin-15 locus. The two lin-15 activities are encoded by contiguous genomic regions and by two distinct, non-overlapping transcripts that may be processed from a single mRNA precursor by trans-splicing. Based on the DNA sequence, the 719- and 1,440-amino acid lin-15 proteins are not similar to each other or to known proteins. lin-15 multivulva mutants, which are defective in both lin-15 activities, contain deletions and insertions that affect the lin-15 genomic region.},

abstract = {Genetic screens for modifiers of activated Ras phenotypes have identified a novel protein, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), which shares significant sequence homology with Raf family protein kinases. Studies using Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans predict that KSR positively regulates Ras signaling; however, the function of mammalian KSR is not well understood. We show here that two predicted kinase-dead mutants of KSR retain the ability to complement ksr-1 loss-of-function alleles in C. elegans, suggesting that KSR may have physiological, kinase-independent functions. Furthermore, we observe that murine KSR forms a multimolecular signaling complex in human embryonic kidney 293T cells composed of HSP90, HSP70, HSP68, p50(CDC37), MEK1, MEK2, 14-3-3, and several other, unidentified proteins. Treatment of cells with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90, decreases the half-life of KSR, suggesting that HSPs may serve to stabilize KSR. Both nematode and mammalian KSRs are capable of binding to MEKs, and three-point mutants of KSR, corresponding to C. elegans loss-of-function alleles, are specifically compromised in MEK binding. KSR did not alter MEK activity or activation. However, KSR-MEK binding shifts the apparent molecular mass of MEK from 44 to {\textgreater}700 kDa, and this results in the appearance of MEK in membrane-associated fractions. Together, these results suggest that KSR may act as a scaffolding protein for the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.},

By screening suppressors of a dominant negative let-60 ras allele, we isolated three loss-of-function mutations in the sur-5 gene which appear to act as negative regulators of let-60 ras during vulval induction. sur-5 mutations do not cause an obvious mutant phenotype of their own, and they appear to specifically suppress only one of the two groups of let-60 ras dominant negative mutations, suggesting that the gene may be involved in a specific aspect of Ras activation. Consistent with its negative function, overexpressing sur-5 from an extragenic array partially suppresses the Multivulva phenotype of an activated let-60 ras mutation and causes synergistic phenotypes with a lin-45 raf mutation. We have cloned sur-5 and shown that it encodes a novel protein. We have also identified a potential mammalian SUR-5 homolog that is about 35{\%} identical to the worm protein. SUR-5 also has some sequence similarity to acetyl coenzyme A synthetases and is predicted to contain ATP/GTP and AMP binding sites. Our results suggest that sur-5 gene function may be conserved through evolution.},

The Let-60 Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway controls vulval induction in Caenorhabditis elegans. Both Lin-45 Raf and Sur-1 MAP kinase have been determined to be essential factors during vulval induction; however, the C. elegans mek gene has not been identified. In this paper, we have cloned a C. elegans mek gene, mek-2, and demonstrated that the MEK-2 protein possesses the biochemical properties of MAP kinase kinases: The C. elegans MEK-2 protein can phosphorylate and activate a human MAP kinase (ERK1), and MEK-2 itself can be phosphorylated and activated by immunoprecipitated mammalian Raf. The mek-2 gene plays a key role in the let-60 ras-mediated vulval induction pathway, as loss-of-function mutations in the gene (ku114 and h294) significantly reduce the signal transmitted through Ras. mek-2(ku114) completely suppressed the Multivulva (Muv) phenotype of a hyperactive let-60 ras mutation, and animals homozygous for mek-2(ku114) also displayed a partial larval lethal phenotype. Animals homozygous for mek-2(h294) exhibited a highly penetrant sterile and Vulvaless phenotype. Microinjection of a gain-of-function mek-2 mutation resulted in Muv and other mutant phenotypes, whereas microinjection of a dominant-negative mutation not only suppressed the Muv phenotype of an activated let-60 ras mutation but also caused an egg-laying defective phenotype in otherwise wild type animals. Our results demonstrate that mek-2 acts between lin-45 raf and sur-1/mpk-1 in a signal transduction pathway used in the control of vulval differentiation and other developmental events.},

abstract = {Ras proteins recruit and activate effectors, including Raf, that transmit receptor-initiated signals. Monomeric Ras can bind Raf; however, activation of Raf requires its dimerization. It has been suspected that dimeric Ras may promote dimerization and activation of Raf. Here, we show that the GTP-bound catalytic domain of K-Ras4B, a highly oncogenic splice variant of the K-Ras isoform, forms stable homodimers. We observe two major dimer interfaces. The first, highly populated $\beta$-sheet dimer interface is at the Switch I and effector binding regions, overlapping the binding surfaces of Raf, PI3K, RalGDS, and additional effectors. This interface has to be inhibitory to such effectors. The second, helical interface also overlaps the binding sites of some effectors. This interface may promote activation of Raf. Our data reveal how Ras self-association can regulate effector binding and activity, and suggest that disruption of the helical dimer interface by drugs may abate Raf signaling in cancer.},

abstract = {During induction of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite vulva by the anchor cell of the gonad, six multipotent vulval precursor cells (VPCs) have two distinct fates: three VPCs generate the vulva and the other three VPCs generate nonspecialized hypodermis. Genes that control the fates of the VPCs in response to the anchor cell signal are defined by mutations that cause all six VPCs to generate vulval tissue (Multivulva or Muv) or that cause all six VPCs to generate hypodermis (Vulvaless or Vul). Seven dominant Vul mutations were isolated as dominant suppressors of a lin-15 Muv mutation. These mutations are dominant alleles of the gene let-60, previously identified only by recessive lethal mutations. Our genetic studies of these dominant Vul recessive lethal mutations, recessive lethal mutations, intragenic revertants of the dominant Vul mutations, and the closely mapping semi-dominant multivulva lin-34 mutations suggest that: (1) loss-of-function mutations of let-60 are recessive lethal at a larval stage, but they also cause a Vul phenotype if the lethality is rescued maternally by a lin-34 gain-of-function mutation. (2) The dominant Vul alleles of let-60 are dominant negative mutations whose gene products compete with wild-type activity. (3) lin-34 semidominant Muv alleles are either gain-of-function mutations of let-60 or gain-of-function mutations of an intimately related gene that elevates let-60 activity. We propose that let-60 activity controls VPC fates. In a wild-type animal, reception by a VPC of inductive signal activates let-60, and it generates into a vulval cell type; in absence of inductive signal, let-60 activity is low and the VPC generates hypodermal cells. Our genetic interaction studies suggest that let-60 acts downstream of let-23 and lin-15 and upstream of lin-1 and lin-12 in the genetic pathway specifying the switch between vulval and nonvulval cell types.},

Furthermore, a spatial EGF gradient, in addition to inducing 1° fate, directly contributes to 2° fate via an unknown pathway. We find that in addition to its canonical effector, Raf, vulval Ras utilizes an exchange factor for the Ral small GTPase (RalGEF), such that Ras-RalGEF-Ral antagonizes Ras-Raf pro-1° fate activity. Consistent with its restricted expression pattern, Ral participates in EGF pro-2° activity. Thus, we have delineated a Ras effector-switching mechanism whereby position within the morphogen gradient dictates that Ras effector usage is switched to RalGEF from Raf to promote 2° instead of 1° fate. Our observations define the utility of Ras effector switching during normal development and may provide a possible mechanistic basis for cell and cancer-type differences in effector dependency and activation.},

We have used a genetic screen in C. elegans to identify genes that antagonize the activity of activated LET-23, a member of the EGFR family of RTKs. We identified two loss-of-function mutations in dpy-22, previously cloned as sop-1, that promote the ability of activated LET-23 to induce ectopic vulval fates. DPY-22 is a glutamine-rich protein that is most similar to human TRAP230, a component of a transcriptional mediator complex. DPY-22 has previously been shown to regulate WNT responses through inhibition of the beta-catenin-like protein BAR-1. We provide evidence that DPY-22 also inhibits RAS-dependent vulval fate specification independently of BAR-1, and probably regulates the activities of multiple transcription factors during development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that although inhibition of BAR-1-dependent gene expression has been shown to require the C-terminal glutamine-rich region, this region is dispensable for inhibition of RAS-dependent cell differentiation. Thus, the glutamine-rich region contributes to specificity of this class of mediator protein.},

abstract = {We are using Caenorhabditis elegans vulval induction to study intercellular signaling and its regulation. Genes required for vulval induction include the LIN-3 transforming alpha-like growth factor, the LET-23 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor-like transmembrane tyrosine kinase, the SEM-5 adaptor protein, LET-60 Ras, and the LIN-45 Raf serine/threonine kinase. Inactivation of this pathway results in a failure of vulval differentiation, the "vulvaless" phenotype. Activation of this pathway either by overexpression of LIN-3, a point mutation in the LET-23 extracellular domain, or hyperactivity of LET-60 Ras results in excessive vulval differentiation, the "multivulva" phenotype. In addition to searching for new genes that act positively in this signaling pathway, we have also characterized genes that negatively regulate this inductive signaling pathway. We find that such negative regulators are functionally redundant: mutation of only one of these negative regulators has no effect on vulval differentiation; however, if particular combinations of these genes are inactivated, excessive vulval differentiation occurs. The LIN-15 locus encodes two functionally redundant products, LIN-15A and LIN-15B, that formally act upstream of the LET-23 receptor to prevent its activity in the absence of inductive signal. The LIN-15A and B proteins are novel and unrelated to each other. The unc-101, sli-1, and rok-1 genes encode a distinct set of negative regulators of vulval differentiation. The unc-101 gene encodes an adaptin, proposed to be involved in intracellular protein trafficking. The sli-1 gene encodes a protein with similarity to c-cbl, a mammalian proto-oncogene not previously linked with a tyrosine kinase-Ras-mediated signaling pathway. LIN-3 and LET-23 are required for several aspects of C. elegans development--larval viability, P12 neuroectoblast specification, hermaphrodite vulval induction and fertility, and three inductions during male copulatory spicule development. Fertility and vulval differentiation appear to be mediated by distinct parts of the cytoplasmic tail of LET-23, and by distinct signal transduction pathways.},

abstract = {Rat sarcoma (Ras) GTPases regulate cell proliferation and survival through effector pathways including Raf-MAPK, and are the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. Although it is well established that Ras activity requires binding to both GTP and the membrane, details of how Ras operates on the cell membrane to activate its effectors remain elusive. Efforts to target mutant Ras in human cancers to therapeutic benefit have also been largely unsuccessful. Here we show that Ras-GTP forms dimers to activate MAPK. We used quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) to analyze the nanoscale spatial organization of PAmCherry1-tagged KRas 4B (hereafter referred to KRas) on the cell membrane under various signaling conditions. We found that at endogenous expression levels KRas forms dimers, and KRas(G12D), a mutant that constitutively binds GTP, activates MAPK. Overexpression of KRas leads to formation of higher order Ras nanoclusters. Conversely, at lower expression levels, KRas(G12D) is monomeric and activates MAPK only when artificially dimerized. Moreover, dimerization and signaling of KRas are both dependent on an intact CAAX (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic; X, any amino acid) motif that is also known to mediate membrane localization. These results reveal a new, dimerization-dependent signaling mechanism of Ras, and suggest Ras dimers as a potential therapeutic target in mutant Ras-driven tumors.},

One component present in other organisms, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, has been missing in C.ELEGANS: To understand the regulation of this pathway it is crucial to have all positive-acting components in hand. Here we describe the identification, cloning and genetic characterization of C.ELEGANS: SOS-1, a putative guanine nucleotide exchanger for LET-60 RAS. RNA interference experiments suggest that SOS-1 participates in RAS-dependent signaling events downstream of LET-23 EGFR, EGL-15 FGFR and an unknown RTK. We demonstrate that the previously identified let-341 gene encodes SOS-1. Analyzing vulval development in a let-341 null mutant, we find an SOS-1-independent pathway involved in the activation of RAS signaling. This SOS-1-independent signaling is not inhibited by SLI-1/Cbl and is not mediated by PTP-2/SHP, raising the possibility that there could be another RasGEF.},

abstract = {EGL-15 is a fibroblast growth factor receptor in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Components that mediate EGL-15 signaling have been identified via mutations that confer a Clear (Clr) phenotype, indicative of hyperactivity of this pathway, or a suppressor-of-Clr (Soc) phenotype, indicative of reduced pathway activity. We have isolated a gain-of-function allele of let-60 ras that confers a Clr phenotype and implicated both let-60 ras and components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in EGL-15 signaling by their Soc phenotype. Epistasis analysis indicates that the gene soc-1 functions in EGL-15 signaling by acting either upstream of or independently of LET-60 RAS. soc-1 encodes a multisubstrate adaptor protein with an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain that is structurally similar to the DOS protein in Drosophila and mammalian GAB1. DOS is known to act with the cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase Corkscrew (CSW) in signaling pathways in Drosophila. Similarly, the C. elegans CSW ortholog PTP-2 was found to be involved in EGL-15 signaling. Structure-function analysis of SOC-1 and phenotypic analysis of single and double mutants are consistent with a model in which SOC-1 and PTP-2 act together in a pathway downstream of EGL-15 and the Src homology domain 2 (SH2)/SH3-adaptor protein SEM-5/GRB2 contributes to SOC-1-independent activities of EGL-15.},

abstract = {Although it is well established that Ras requires membrane localization for activation of its target molecule, Raf-1, the reason for this requirement is not fully understood. In this study, we found that modified Ras, which is purified from Sf9 cells, could activate Raf-1 in a cell-free system, when incorporated into liposome. Using a bifunctional cross-linker and a protein-fragmentation complementation assay, we detected dimer formation of Ras in the liposome and in the intact cells, respectively. These results suggest that dimerization of Ras in the lipid membrane is essential for activation of Raf-1. To support this, we found that, when fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), unprocessed Ras expressed in Escherichia coli could bypass the requirement for liposome. A Ras-dependent Raf-1 activator, which we previously reported (Mizutani, S., Koide, H., and Kaziro, Y. (1998) Oncogene 16, 2781-2786), was still required for Raf-1 activation by GST-Ras. Furthermore, an enforced dimerization of unmodified oncogenic Ras mutant in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, using a portion of gyrase B or estrogen receptor, also resulted in activation of Raf-1. From these results, we conclude that membrane localization allows Ras to form a dimer, which is essential, although not sufficient, for Raf-1 activation.},

To identify components acting downstream of let-60 ras in the vulval signaling pathway, we have identified a reduction-of-function mutation in the sur-1 gene that completely suppresses the multivulva phenotype of a hyperactive let-60 ras mutation. About 10{\%} of animals homozygous for the sur-1 mutation also display a specific and intriguing vulval cell lineage defect. In addition, the sur-1 mutation results in a cold-sensitive egg-laying defective phenotype and a partial larval lethal phenotype. We have cloned the sur-1 gene by DNA-mediated transformation and have shown that it encodes a protein similar in overall structure to mammalian MAP kinases (ERKs). The functional homology between Sur-1 MAP kinase and mammalian MAP kinases was also demonstrated by the ability of a rat ERK2 kinase to rescue the sur-1 mutant phenotypes. Genetic double-mutant analyses place sur-1 downstream of let-60 ras but upstream of lin-1 in the vulval signaling pathway. Our results provide further evidence for the extreme conservation of Ras-mediated signaling pathway between worms and humans and for the function of MAP kinases in cell signaling processes that control cell differentiation and animal development.},

Despite the identification of developmental processes in which invagination is a critical component of pattern formation, little is known regarding the underlying cellular and molecular details. Caenorhabditis elegans vulval epithelial cells undergo morphological changes that generate an invagination through the formation of seven stacked rings. Here, we study the dynamics of ring formation during multivulva morphogenesis of a let-60/ras gain-of-function mutant as a model system to explore the cellular mechanisms that drive invagination. The behavior of individual cells was analyzed in a let-60/ras mutant by three-dimensional confocal microscopy. We showed that stereotyped cell fusion events occur within the rings that form functional and nonfunctional vulvae in a let-60/ras mutant. Expression of let-60/ras gain-of-function results in abnormal cell migration, ectopic cell fusion, and structural fate transformation. Within each developing vulva the anterior and posterior halves develop autonomously. Contrary to prevailing hypotheses which proposed three cell fates (1°, 2°, and 3°), we found that each of the seven rings is a product of a discrete structural pathway that is derived from arrays of seven distinct cell fates (A, B, C, D, E, F, and H). We have also shown how autonomous ring formation is the morphogenetic force that drives invagination of the vulva.},

The molecular physiology of this state has not been studied as intensely as other parts of the life cycle, in spite of documented changes in behavior and metabolism that occur at this stage. To study the female state of C. elegans, we designed an experiment to measure the transcriptome of 1st day adult females, endogenous, 6th day adult females, as well as mutant feminized worms that never go through a hermaphrodite stage at these time points. Using this experimental design, we were able to measure the effects of biological aging from the transition into the female state. We find that spermless young adult animals partially phenocopy 6 day old wild-type animals that have depleted their sperm after egg-laying, and that spermless animals also exhibit less transcriptomic changes associated with aging throughout these 6 days.

By screening suppressors of a dominant negative let-60 ras allele, we isolated three loss-of-function mutations in the sur-5 gene which appear to act as negative regulators of let-60 ras during vulval induction. sur-5 mutations do not cause an obvious mutant phenotype of their own, and they appear to specifically suppress only one of the two groups of let-60 ras dominant negative mutations, suggesting that the gene may be involved in a specific aspect of Ras activation. Consistent with its negative function, overexpressing sur-5 from an extragenic array partially suppresses the Multivulva phenotype of an activated let-60 ras mutation and causes synergistic phenotypes with a lin-45 raf mutation. We have cloned sur-5 and shown that it encodes a novel protein. We have also identified a potential mammalian SUR-5 homolog that is about 35{\%} identical to the worm protein. SUR-5 also has some sequence similarity to acetyl coenzyme A synthetases and is predicted to contain ATP/GTP and AMP binding sites. Our results suggest that sur-5 gene function may be conserved through evolution.},

We have cloned the let-60 gene, and shown that it encodes a gene product identical in 84{\%} of its first 164 amino acids to ras gene products from other vertebrate and invertebrate species. This conservation suggests that the let-60 product contains all the biochemical functions of ras proteins. Extrachromosomal arrays of let-60 ras DNA cause cell-type misspecification (extra vulval fates) phenotypically opposite to that caused by let-60 ras loss-of-function mutations (no vulval fates), and suppress the vulvaless phenotype of mutations in two other genes necessary for vulval induction. Thus, the level and pattern of let-60 ras expression may be under strict regulation; increase in let-60 ras activity bypasses or reduces the need for upstream genes in the vulval induction pathway. ? 1990.},

We have previously carried out screens for suppressors of activated Ras to identify factors that play critical roles in the regulation of the pathway. ku258 was isolated as a semidominant allele that suppresses the Multivulva phenotype caused by activated let-60 ras. Our genetic and molecular analyses indicate that ku258 is a gain-of-function allele resulting from two point mutations in the C. elegans homolog of the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP, cbp-1. Genetic data also suggest that cbp-1 may act downstream of the Ras signaling pathway, but not primarily downstream of the Wnt signaling pathway, to negatively regulate vulval cell fate specification. cbp-1 may function in concert with LIN-1, an Ets transcription factor family member that is one of the targets of MAPK. In vitro histone acetylation assays have revealed that together, the two point mutations cause a sevenfold increase in the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of recombinant CBP-1. To our knowledge, this is the only such HAT activity mutation isolated in a CBP/p300 family protein, and this mutation may define a negative role of the HAT activity in antagonizing Ras function in a specific developmental event.},

Because mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated by receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in vertebrate cells, we hypothesized that C. elegans MAP kinase homologs may play a role in vulval induction. Two C. elegans MAP kinase genes, mpk-1 and mpk-2 (mpk, MAP kinase), were cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide primers and PCR amplification; in parallel, genes involved in vulval induction were identified by screening for mutations that suppress the vulval defects caused by an activated let-60 ras gene. One such suppressor mutation is an allele of mpk-1. We used a new type of mosaic analysis to show that mpk-1 acts cell autonomously in the Pn.p cells. Our results show that mpk-1 plays an important functional role as an activator in ras-mediated cell signaling in vivo.},

Here, we present the WormBase Enrichment Suite, which offers users the ability to test all nematode ontologies simultaneously. We show that the WormBase Enrichment Suite provides valuable insight into different biological problems. Briefly, we show that phenotype enrichment analysis (PEA) can help researchers identify disease phenologs, phenotypes that are homologous across species, which can inform disease modeling in C. elegans. The WormBase Enrichment Suite analysis can also shed light on RNA-seq datasets by showing what molecular functions are enriched, which phenotypes these functions are implicated in and what tissues are overrepresented in the dataset. Finally, we explore the phenotype-anatomy relationship, showing that a small subset of highly specific tissues are disproportionately likely to cause an Egl phenotype, but inferring tissue expression from an Egl phenotype is limited to the largest tissues.},

In invertebrates, the proliferation of female germline stem cells is regulated by nutritional status. However, in mammals, the number of female germline stem cells is set early in development, with oocytes progressing through meiosis later in life. Mechanisms that couple later steps of oogenesis to environmental conditions remain largely undefined. We show that, in the presence of food, the DAF-2 insulin-like receptor signals through the RAS-ERK pathway to drive meiotic prophase I progression and oogenesis; in the absence of food, the resultant inactivation of insulin-like signaling leads to downregulation of the RAS-ERK pathway, and oogenesis is stalled. Thus, the insulin-like signaling pathway couples nutrient sensing to meiotic I progression and oocyte production in C. elegans, ensuring that oocytes are only produced under conditions favorable for the survival of the resulting zygotes.},

abstract = {The lipid-anchored small GTPase Ras is an important signaling node in mammalian cells. A number of observations suggest that Ras is laterally organized within the cell membrane, and this may play a regulatory role in its activation. Lipid anchors composed of palmitoyl and farnesyl moieties in H-, N-, and K-Ras are widely suspected to be responsible for guiding protein organization in membranes. Here, we report that H-Ras forms a dimer on membrane surfaces through a protein-protein binding interface. A Y64A point mutation in the switch II region, known to prevent Son of sevenless and PI3K effector interactions, abolishes dimer formation. This suggests that the switch II region, near the nucleotide binding cleft, is either part of, or allosterically coupled to, the dimer interface. By tethering H-Ras to bilayers via a membrane-miscible lipid tail, we show that dimer formation is mediated by protein interactions and does not require lipid anchor clustering. We quantitatively characterize H-Ras dimerization in supported membranes using a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, photon counting histogram analysis, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, single-molecule tracking, and step photobleaching analysis. The 2D dimerization Kd is measured to be ∼1 × 10(3) molecules/µm(2), and no higher-order oligomers were observed. Dimerization only occurs on the membrane surface; H-Ras is strictly monomeric at comparable densities in solution. Analysis of a number of H-Ras constructs, including key changes to the lipidation pattern of the hypervariable region, suggest that dimerization is a general property of native H-Ras on membrane surfaces.},
